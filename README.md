# R2D2 Algorithm

## Description
The R2D2 algorithm takes a hybrid structure between a Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithm and a learned version of the well-known Matching Pursuit algorithm. Its reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively estimated as outputs of iteration-specific Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), each taking the previous iterationâ€™s image estimate and associated back-projected data residual as inputs.  The R2D2 algorithm comes in two incarnations. The first uses the well-known U-Net architecture for
its DNNs, and is simply referred to as R2D2. The second uses a more advanced architecture dubbed R2D2-Net, obtained by unrolling the R2D2 algorithm itself. In reference to its nesting structure, this incarnation is referred to as R3D3. The primary application of the R2D2 algorithm is to solve large-scale high-resolution high-dynamic range inverse problems in radio astronomy, more specifically 2D planar monochromatic intensity imaging.

## Input files
Both R2D2 and R3D3 series are trained to form images of size `512x512` from data acquired by the Very Large Array (VLA). The input dirty images (i.e., the back-projected data) are expected to have a pixel size corresponding to a super resolution factor of `1.5`, and to be obtained using the data-weighting scheme Briggs. To run the R2D2 algorithm, data and DNN files are required. To run the R2D2 algorithm, data and DNN files are required.

### Trained DNN series
The VLA-trained R2D2 and R3D3 DNN series are available at the DOI:[10.17861/99cbe654-5071-4625-b59d-a26c790cbeb4](https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/datasets/r2d2-deep-neural-network-series-for-radio-interferometric-imaging). DNN files must be saved in a desired path `$ONNX_DIR`, under the following filename convention.
 
- For R2D2,  its `$I` U-Net components are structured inside `$ONNX_DIR` as follows:
```Python
$ONNX_DIR'/R2D2_UNet_N1.onnx'
$ONNX_DIR'/R2D2_UNet_N2.onnx'
..
$ONNX_DIR'/R2D2_UNet_N'$I'.onnx'
```
- For R3D3, its `$I` R2D2-Net components (each composed of `$J` network layers) are structured in sub-directories inside `$ONNX_DIR`.  The `$J` U-Net layers of each R2D2-Net are saved in separate files as follows:
```Python
$ONNX_DIR'/R3D3_R2D2Net_'$J'Layers_N1/R3D3_R2D2Net_'$J'Layers_N1_L1.onnx'
..
$ONNX_DIR'/R3D3_R2D2Net_'$J'Layers_N1/R3D3_R2D2Net_'$J'Layers_N1_L'$J'.onnx'
$ONNX_DIR'/R3D3_R2D2Net_'$J'Layers_N2/R3D3_R2D2Net_'$J'Layers_N2_L1.onnx'
..
$ONNX_DIR'/R3D3_R2D2Net_'$J'Layers_N2/R3D3_R2D2Net_'$J'Layers_N2_L'$J'.onnx'
..
$ONNX_DIR'/R3D3_R2D2Net_'$J'Layers_N'$I'/R3D3_R2D2Net_'$J'Layers_N'$I'_L1.onnx'
..
$ONNX_DIR'/R3D3_R2D2Net_'$J'Layers_N'$I'/R3D3_R2D2Net_'$J'Layers_N'$I'_L'$J'.onnx'
```
### Input data (measurement) file

   ```Matlab 
   "y"               %% vector; data (Stokes I)
   "u"               %% vector; u coordinate (in units of the wavelength)
